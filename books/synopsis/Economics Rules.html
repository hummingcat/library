1.	What do models do
<br><br>
Models try to “capture the most relevant aspect of reality in a given context.” It therefore has to simplify the reality. Instead of searching for a single universal model, the most suitable model should be selected depending on the context. Models act as fables that shape people’s way of thinking, and experiments that identify causal relationships in explaining the world. Modern Economics models appear to suffer from unrealistic assumptions and excessive math. Unrealistic assumptions are encouraged by Milton Friedman’s seminal idea that what matters most is the correct prediction. But assumptions that violate the reality will eventually render a model un-predictive when the specific circumstances change. On math, it is a useful tool to clarify ideas and argue in a systematic way, but too much of it defeats the purpose for a model to effectively convey messages and shed light on real-life problems.
<br><br>
2.	Economics as a science
<br><br>
Economists believe they work on science by using the deductive, hypothesis-testing approach. In reality, they often just reversely make models to explain reality, and many of the hypotheses are not testable in a substantive way. A model however sets out the assumptions in making a conclusion, and is helpful in a debate. Economics built by shared methodologies is also subject to checking. 
<br><br>
3.	Choosing models
<br><br>
In a diagnostic analysis, we choose for the most suitable model by comparing the key assumptions that are critical to the real problem. In recent years, more experiments and field studies are used to test the theories.
<br><br>
4.	Theories and models
<br><br>
Theories are usually more general than models, but similarly they should only be adopted depending on context.
<br><br>
5.	When economists go wrong
<br><br>
Economists overwhelmingly converge in views over public discourse. This resulted in serious misses such as the 2008 financial crisis and ineffective programs such as the market reforms in developing countries. Economists active in the public sphere are often not challenged enough beyond the academic circle and hijack the discussion.
<br><br>
6.	Other criticisms
<br><br>
One criticism to Economics is its promotion of self-interest corrupts other social values. Efficiency on its own is no doubt good, but economists should beware the potential trade-offs for other objectives such as equity and morality. Another criticism is the lack of plurality in Economics. The solution to this is to treat the subject as a collection of models that are diverse tools for analysis.
