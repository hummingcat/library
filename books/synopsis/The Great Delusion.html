1.	Introduction
<br><br>
2.	Human nature
<br><br>
Political conflicts result from individuals disagreeing on what is good or right. Liberalism wrongly depicts the society as merely a collection of individuals. In fact, individuals are social beings that are deeply influenced by culture and institutions of the society.
<br><br>
3.	Political liberalism
<br><br>
Liberalism emphasizes on individual rights and tolerance. However, liberals are divided on social engineering by the government to promote equal rights, which is unpreferred by traditional liberals but promoted by progressive liberals. In reality, political liberalism is dominated by progressive liberals.
<br><br>
4.	Flaws of liberalism
<br><br>
Liberalism holds a radical view on individuals and rights. Nationalism, in contrast, focuses on the common identity and cohesion. It trumps liberalism by appealing to people’s emotional need for a sense of belonging. In theory, a liberal state merely exists to perform its function to protect rights, and “it is hard to motivate people to fight and die for a purely liberal state.” That is why “liberalism always operates within the context of a nation state.” Liberalism also oversells rights by unrealistically claiming them “universal and inalienable.” Compared with social stability, people are often less concerned about rights.
<br><br>
5.	Liberal foreign policy
<br><br>
Constrained by anarchy in the international system, states take the realist approach in order to survive. There is no place for natural rights, especially of others. Taking advantage of unipolarity, the US did manage to pursue liberal hegemony after the cold war. However, the interventionist approach creates trouble when facing foreign nationalism which intrinsically resists foreign interference.
<br><br>
6.	Liberal hegemony
<br><br>
Adopting liberalism as its moral compass, the US develops “liberal intolerance” against other illiberal states, and is enticed to wage wars on them. Yet more often the target such as the Middle East states turn into chaos rather than stable democracies. On the other hand, great powers such as China and Russia are riled up as they perceive the liberal agenda as stepping into their backyard. Ironically, liberal hegemony harms civil liberties in the US itself as the appetite for wars and interventions encourage its departure from transparency and the rule of law. Instilling democracy in other states, such a “utopian social engineering scheme” is destined to fail.
<br><br>
7.	Liberal theories of peace
<br><br>
The liberal peace theory is built on the pinnacles of democracy, economic interdependence, and institutions. In gist, they are oversold. Democracies did fight each other, where notably the US toppled a number of democratic governments, including Iran in 1953 and Egypt in 2013. Similarly, economic interdependence and institutions cannot always deter wars or civil wars. “Democratic trust and respect has often been subordinated to security and economic interests,” where realism rules.
<br><br>
8.	Restraint
<br><br>
Looking ahead, if the global balance of power gravitates from unipolarity to bipolarity with the rise of China, the US will be pressured to abandon liberal hegemony and “pursue a foreign policy of restraint”.
