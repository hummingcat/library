1.	Demagogues can rise from democratic systems
<br><br>
Hitler, Mussolini, and Chavez all came to power through democratic processes. Indicative behaviors of potential authoritarians are (i) rejection of democratic rules, (ii) denial of legitimacy of opponents, (iii) encouragement of violence, (iv) restriction of civil liberties. Gatekeeping of democracy requires efforts from mainstream parties to isolate from such extremists. Successful examples include Belgium and Finland defending themselves from the far-right from the 1920s to 1930s.  
<br><br>
2-4.	American Parties as Gatekeepers
<br><br>
There has been no lack of demagogue candidates throughout America’s presidential election such as Charles Coughlin, Huey Long, Joseph McCarthy, George Wallace. They all had an authoritarian tendency and earned 30% to 40% approval rating at the time, but were stopped by the parties’ conventions.
<br><br>
These conventions carry the dual and sometimes conflicting roles of nominating the popular candidate and filtrating demagogues. Traditionally they were dominated by party leaders until the Democratic convention in 1968 nominated Humphrey who had not participated in the primaries, prompting wide backlash and reform. In 1972, both parties adopted the McGovern-Fraser Commission’s recommendation to open the selection process to voters. In the 1980s, the Democrats backtracked by assigning 15% to 20% of “superdelegates” who are appointed by the party, but the Republicans did not follow.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, non-established candidates still need to face an “invisible primary” of money and media coverage. But outside money and social media gradually changed the landscape. Donald Trump, a billionaire and celebrity easily overcame the “invisible primary” in 2016.
<br><br>
Trump displayed all four indicative authoritative behaviors when campaigning. He said there was a national voting fraud and suggested that he might not accept the result. He challenged Obama’s birthplace and religion as un-American and called Hillary a criminal. He tolerated and praised violence used by his supporters in speeches. He threatened to imprison Hillary and go after unfriendly media. Despite the alarms, most Republican leaders chose the party line instead of blocking Trump with the Democrats.
<br><br>
5-6.	Unwritten Rules
<br><br>
Contrary to the deep faith of many Americans, the US Constitution alone does not provide a lot of safeguard for democracy. Many Latin countries and the Philippines adopt a constitution very similar to the US’, but still plunged into dictatorship.
<br><br>
Two fundamental unwritten rules to democracy are mutual tolerance and institutional forbearance. Mutual tolerance is accepting rivals as legitimate, and institutional forbearance is the restraint from exercising a legal right so as not to imperil the system. Losing them will result in an escalating brinkmanship and can bring down a stable democracy to dictatorship as Chile did in 1973.
<br><br>
American president and congress each have three powerful weapons unchecked by the Constitution.

The weapons have generally been exercised in restraint, but the tradition started to unravel decades before Trump. Newt Gingrich introduced the hardline combative style in 1978 and heavily influenced the Republicans by being the whip in 1989 and the Speaker of the House in 1995. House Republicans launched vigorous filibusters and government shutdowns in the 1990s against Clinton. Senate Democrats acted similarly to Bush in early 2000s and blocked several judicial appointments. Intolerance went high and penetrated into Republican leaders in 2008 against Obama. Facing Republican senators’ obstructionism, Obama responded with record number of executive orders. In 2016, Republicans refused Obama’s pick of Supreme Court justice’s replacement.
<br><br>
The background for such partisan aggression may be due to the civil right movements in 1965 separating voters by race, changing the two parties from big tents to homogeneous ideology blocs. In addition, “real” Americans – white protestants are shrinking in size, heightening the sense of threat among republican voters and shaping them a more hostile attitude to political rivals.

7-8.	Democratic Breakdown Process
<br><br>
Democratic breakdown often takes place piecemeal. Autocrats first capture the referees. Neutral bodies such as the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, tax, regulatory agencies are bought off or purged. Then, they weaken opponents including dissidents, media, business and cultural leaders. Lastly, they change the rules such as the constitution so as to consolidate their power in a permanent manner. Compared to the old-schooled dictators, the modern approach provides a veneer of legality to autocrats. In many cases, autocrats trigger the power grab by exploiting crises, when citizens are more tolerant of authoritative measures.
<br><br>
Backsliding can take years. Nine examples of elected potential authoritarians in the first year of office:

In the first year of office, Trump applied all three strategies for autocrats to consolidate powers. He fired the commissioner of the FBI and attacked the Office of Government Ethics. He disrespected media and accused the New York Times and CNN as fake news. He pushed for voter ID laws which some accused as preventing lower-income citizens from voting. He displayed a real threat to America’s democracy.

9.	Way forward
<br><br>
Trump has to be resisted within the democratic institutions, across the political spectrum. Republicans should reform the party to free itself from “populism, nativism, and demagoguery.” Democrats should work harder on reducing economic inequality that fuels resentment.
