Beginning with a story in the 1980s when some art experts spotted a fake statue in a blink, the book explores how people make snap decisions subconsciously and how can we make good use of it.</p>

1.	Thin Slices
<br><br>
A few key signals are enough to form a complex judgement. For instance, you can predict with 90% accuracy if a couple will divorce in 15 years by watching a 15-minute clip, solely focusing on 4 negative interactions – defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Sometimes we thin-slice even before making sense of it. Scouts can often identify great players or actors by intuition without really explaining why.
<br><br>
2.	Black box process
<br><br>
Our behavior can be primed in an unnoticed way. An experiment showed that merely exposing to vocabularies related with rudeness can subconsciously make us impolite. Clueless to the subconscious, we often try to explain our decision-making with the conscious, resulting in a storytelling problem where the causal relationship we believe is true is actually a made-up theory.
<br><br>
3.	Danger of rapid cognition
<br><br>
We discriminate in the subconscious level more likely than we think. Tests showed that most people took longer time to associate career with women and good things with blacks.
<br><br>
4.	Jamming the insight
<br><br>
Explaining and reflecting may actually distract us from making the flash of insight. Verbal overshadowing occurs as the verbal left brain takes over the pattern recognition of the right brain.	Having too much information backfires, especially when speedy decisions are required.
<br><br>
5.	Context of thin slicing
<br><br>
Market researchers frequently make the mistake of testing products in a wrong context. Coca Cola created a disaster in the 1980s by changing the formula based on a blind sip test, omitting the fact that people drink in a whole can as well as the sensation transference of the brand’s imagery. Thin slicing from uninformed people can therefore be unreliable and misleading. While it is not unusual for laymen to tell a Coke from a Pepsi, most of them will fail the triangle test – to pick the outlier out of 2 cola A and 1 cola B. The test is hard because it requires you to hold and describe the taste consciously. Meanwhile, true experts can easily pass the test by connecting their first impression to their training and knowledge on the subject.
<br><br>
6.	Slow down
<br><br>
People can read others’ mind from their face either naturally or after some training. But it is easy to lose that ability under high time pressure and stress. We tend to fall back to our stereotype to make the split-second decision. Slowing things down may help us avoid mistakes made under an unnecessary hurry.
