<p>
The book discusses how people make choices under radical uncertainty and challenges the conventional approach of rationality and probabilistic utility maximizing.

1.	Risk and uncertainty are different
<br><br>
Risk is resolvable and can be modelled by probability distributions. Uncertainty is radical, resulting from the fact that we simply do not know the full picture of all possible outcomes.
<br><br>
2.	Solvable puzzles are incomplete
<br><br>
Modern decision theory often attempts to frame a mystery into puzzles, where definite answers can be obtained. It “limits the interest and relevance of both problems and answers.”
<br><br>
3.	Imperfect information
<br><br>
Very often, information is insufficient for any of the rigorous decision-making methods. Even if there is quality data, the aggregate statistics may not apply well to each unique setting. People resort to coping, instead of optimizing when making decisions, i.e. they incrementally try to result in a position better than the current state.
<br><br>
4.	History of probability theory
<br><br>
5.	Subjective Probability
<br><br>
Sometimes probability is used just to denote the confidence level rather than the expected frequency of the event. In fact, trying to attach a probability to every possible event is unlikely to produce a sum of one.
<br><br>
6.	Likelihood is not perceived statistically
<br><br>
The daily usage of likelihood is non-probabilistic, but associated with contexts. For example, a more specific event is interpreted as more “likely” because the additional information is helpful in presenting a more complete story.
<br><br>
7.	People do not behave rationally
<br><br>
A rational person maximizes his expected utility. However, experiments and real life observations show that people do not behave in such way. Emotions and having multiple objectives are possible explanations.
<br><br>
8.	Abductive reasoning
<br><br>
Deductive reasoning starts with some premises and produces results from logical relationships. Inductive reasoning starts with observations and infers a general truth. Abductive reasoning starts with observations and looks for the most likely cause. Academically, rationality is based on axioms and deductive reasoning, but in reality abductive reasoning is more commonly used to solve complex problems. The irrational human behavior observed in Behavioral Economics may after all be rational “if rationality is defined by reasonable beliefs and internal consistency” under unclear contexts.
<br><br>
9.	Inborn decision making process
<br><br>
Actions may simply be driven by nature instead of by utility calculation, for example, being nice to a stranger. Evolution may have given us traits to react not in a way to optimize, but to survive.
<br><br>
10.	Common errors in decision making
<br><br>
First, trying to understand with numbers, but the numbers are in fact unreliable or missing the point. Second, setting an objective without seriously understanding your character and purpose. Third, applying a solution in a wrong context. Approaching unique events is like the study of history, “it is not factuality, but the emphasis on the essential.” You need to figure out what is going on before any metrics, models, and analysis.
<br><br>
11.	Legal reasoning
<br><br>
Judges and juries are tasked to take away any prior beliefs when making decisions in the court. This in itself contradicts with the setting of Bayesian statistics. In fact, the presumption of innocence implies that we are not making sense of a case in the ordinary statistical sense. “Statistical reasoning can assist, but never replace, narrative reasoning.”
<br><br>
12.	Narratives help us make sense of uncertainty
<br><br>
Narratives attach emotions to our understanding of the world, and help build up our conviction to things. Even reasonable men once believed in narratives seen as silly today as knowledge evolves. It “need not be true to yield insight”. For example, business plan figures are seldom accurate, but are helpful for executives to translate a vision into concrete plans.
<br><br>
13.	Use and misuse of statistics
<br><br>
14.	Models
<br><br>
Models try to illustrate a principle in a simple way, but they may incorporate unrealistic assumptions. The traditional approach is to test a theory by examining the accuracy of its predictions. But this has encouraged holding on to theories that fail to predict by shifting the blame to non-fulfilment of the underlying assumptions.

<br><br>
16.	Judging decisions by results
<br><br>
We usually judge the decision maker by looking at the result, which is different from the reasoning, or the decision making process. The latter is important because human’s capability essentially comes from cooperation, in which communication is the key.
<br><br>
17.	Debating
<br><br>
Groupthink occurs when nobody bothers to challenge the prevailing narrative. Many successful leaders allow debates so that risks of a particular plan can be thoroughly discussed.
<br><br>
18.	Financial market
<br><br>
“The corpus of finance theory based on portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and the efficient market hypothesis” are useful in understanding concepts such as that information is embedded in prices and diversification reduces risks. Taking them literally will however be silly for investors and perhaps disastrous for regulators.
<br><br>
19.	The role of risk in insurance and investment
<br><br>
20.	Models going wrong
<br><br>
Models are widely used to aid decision making, but also risk being exploited by leaders to justify their decisions. Multiple examples showed that they could be unreliable, for example capital models being unable to warn before the 2008 financial crisis. Others are dubious, for example projections models showing a costly infrastructure would bring a net gain in 50 years’ time.
<br><br>
21.	Problems of modern Economics
<br><br>
Modern Economics overemphasize on developing models over studying actual data. Economists are also obsessive to develop a general theory than to solve a specific problem with its own facts.
<br><br>
22.	Summary
<br><br>
23.	Embracing uncertainty
Linking risk with volatility creates an illusion, that we think there is no risk as we see no volatility, but the current stability can prelude a sudden financial crisis. A good strategy should therefore cater for more possibilities and allow sufficient room for adjustments. Uncertainty can be detrimental to development, but can also drive progress. It is the narrative and responses that matter.
