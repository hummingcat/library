The book compares China’s rise under the dominance of America to the Thucydides’ Trap. It warns of potential deadly clashes in future, and suggests possible mitigations.

1.	China has risen
<br><br>
China has risen greatly and quickly. In fact, it has surpassed the US in many indicators already, for example, it was the top producer and seller of automobiles. Facing international institutions traditionally ruled by the West, China countered with its economic leverage or simply set up new initiatives.
<br><br>
2.	US’s geographic security
<br><br>
As early as in the 1890s, the US enforced the Monroe Doctrine that rejected European states interfering in the Western Hemisphere. That was demonstrated by the Spanish-American War and the face-offs with Berlin and London over Venezuela. President Roosevelt went further in the 1900s in securing the Panama Canal and the Alaskan coastline.
<br><br>
3.	China’s dream
<br><br>
President Xi promoted the vision of a Chinese renaissance, both economically and militarily. Internally, he centralized his power and control over the party. Externally, he expanded China’s influence in the South China Sea and Eurasia.
<br><br>
4.	Clash of civilizations
<br><br>
China is a civilization fundamentally different from the US. It favors an effective governance order over liberal democracy. Realpolitik also pervades the Chinese leadership, making it “ruthlessly flexible” in pursuing national interests, and highly distrusts the US.
<br><br>
5.	Potential wars
<br><br>
A war can be triggered by sparks in the South China Sea, Taiwan, or a third country such as Japan and North Korea.
<br><br>
6.	Avoiding wars
<br><br>
Historically, some Thucydides’ Traps were avoided by institutions (Germany after the Cold War), forbearance (the US in the 1990s), and tacit restraints (the Soviet Union). Since the Cold War ended, the US has adopted the “engage but hedge” strategy with China, in the hope that China will democratize and become a “responsible stakeholder” as it gets rich. To shape the future strategy, it is important to clarify and communicate on vital interests. The US and China can perhaps also focus on the serious problems within the domestic system.
