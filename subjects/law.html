 (HCAL 69/2007 Cho Man Kit v Broadcasting Authority by Michael Hartmann in HK High Court)
<br>

A judicial review case in Hong Kong that overruled the Broadcasting Authority’s ruling on a documentary that featured homosexuality. The programme was initially ruled as failing to be impartial, where the absence of different views on homosexual marriage was deemed as promoting the subject. Judge Michael Hartmann clarified that impartiality did not mean “‘both sides of the story’ must always be put.” It was a “broad concept”, encompassing “the concept of being balanced”, as well as being “‘unprejudiced, unbiased, fair’.” He noted “the programme manifestly was not designed as a vehicle to ‘advocate’ any particular point of view” and was merely “a study of the human condition.” The programme should not be considered a breach merely because there was a huge sentiment against the subject, i.e. “‘prejudices, personal aversions and dubious rationalisations’,” or else that would impose “an impermissible restriction on the freedom of speech.” (para. 66-92)
