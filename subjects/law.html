<h3>2008 May 8 - HK High Court Judgment - Programme Impartiality</h3>

 (HCAL 69/2007 Cho Man Kit v Broadcasting Authority by Michael Hartmann in HK High Court)
<br>

A judicial review case in Hong Kong that clarified on the concept of impartialilty, in particular in the media context. A documentary that featured homosexuality was initially ruled by the Broadcasting Authority as failing to be impartial, where the absence of different views on homosexual marriage was deemed as promoting the subject. Judge Hartmann clarified that impartiality did not mean “‘both sides of the story’ must always be put.” It was a “broad concept”, encompassing “the concept of being balanced”, as well as being “‘unprejudiced, unbiased, fair’.” He noted “the programme manifestly was not designed as a vehicle to ‘advocate’ any particular point of view” and was merely “a study of the human condition.” The programme should not be considered a breach merely because there was a huge sentiment against the subject, i.e. “‘prejudices, personal aversions and dubious rationalisations’,” or else that would impose “an impermissible restriction on the freedom of speech.” (para. 66-92)

 (HCAL 1601/2020 Tong Ying Kit v HKSAR by Anderson Chow and Alex Lee in HK High Court)
<br>
A case on the bail regime under HK National Security Law (NSL). Charged under NSL, Lai was refused bail in the Magistrates' Courts citing NSL Article 42(2) “No bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” He appealed successfully in the High Court and was granted bail, where Judge Lee believed the stringent conditions would satisfactorily mitigate Lai's risk of “absconding” or “re-offending” based on considerations under Criminal Procedure Ordinance (CPO). Following the prosecution’s immediate appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, Lai was ordered to be remanded back in custody two days later pending determination of the appeal. The ultimate judgment in the Court of Final Appeal by Chief Justice Li et al. promulgated that the bail regime under NSL was distinct from that under CPO, “introducing a new and more stringent threshold requirement for the grant of bail.” It “displaces … the presumption in favour of bail” as reflected by a starting point of no bail. The burden on the accused existed and could be justified by similar examples in other jurisdictions. As the High Court’s judgment misinterpreted NSL's bailing threshold as materially the same as that of CPO, Lai’s case was revoked. In relation, the related legal principles adopted in a previous case on Tong Ying Kit, another person charged under NSL were also voided.
