 (HCAL69/2007 Cho Man Kit v Broadcasting Authority by Michael Hartmann in HK High Court)
<br>

A judicial review case in Hong Kong that overruled the Broadcasting Authority's ruling on a documentary that featured homosexuality. The programme was initially ruled as failing to be impartial, with the absence of different views on homosexual marriage, leading to a promotion of the subject. Judge Michael Hartmann clarified that impartiality did not mean “‘both sides of the story’ must always be put." It was a “broad concept", encompassing "the concept of being balanced", as well as “‘unprejudiced, unbiased, fair’." He noted “the programme manifestly was not designed as a vehicle to ‘advocate’ any particular point of view" and was merely "a study of the human condition." The programme should not be considered a breach merely because of a certain consensus of opinion against the subject, i.e. based on "‘prejudices, personal aversions and dubious rationalisations’," or else would impose "an impermissible restriction on the freedom of speech." (para. 66-92)
