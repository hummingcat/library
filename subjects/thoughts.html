The essay had been widely circulated since 1979 after Havel's arrest. Inspiring tons of people in Eastern Europe reigned by communist regimes, many trace its spiritual impact to the fall of the Berlin Wall and Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution in 1989. Why did the grocery owner place a sign of “Workers of the world, unite!”? Not because he truly believed in it, Havel argued, but due to fear of violating the societal norm. He “lived withnin a lie” by supporting a strange ideology, and became “both a victim ... and an instrument” of the suppressive system. In the other way round, “every free human act or expression, every attempt to live within the truth, ... appear as a threat to the system.” Instead of being a political dissident, individuals can confront the system by simply being true to themselves.
